-2	I think the US should have more open borders
-2	Sgt. Tahmooressi should stay in Mexican prison and should not be released until he has completed his due process

-2	The "Brain Drain" of Immigrants is Helping This Country (The United States) More Than It's Hurting It
-2	I think telling native citizens to adapt to incoming immigrant cultures is worse than telling incoming immigrants to adapt to native cultures.
-2	I believe the idea of borders (countries, provinces, etc.) are a remnant of older times that society should have risen above by now.
