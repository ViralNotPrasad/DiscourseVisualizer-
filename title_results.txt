Western countries should only take in women, children, and elder refugees from Syria
The debate to allow Syrian refugees into the US is a pointless argument

As much as refugees are a big issue, in Syria and the surrounding areas, military intervention is equally crucial.
Europe has a responsibility to help the refugees (and, to an extent, towards all immigrants) because of their colonial brutality in Africa and Asia.
The United States is unfairly judged for wanting to stop illegal immigration, when the rest of the world is doing the same thing.

I think the US should have more open borders
Sgt. Tahmooressi should stay in Mexican prison and should not be released until he has completed his due process

The U.S. should adopt a policy of open borders. CMV.
I believe that the United States should offer a pathway to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants.

I believe the idea of borders (countries, provinces, etc.) are a remnant of older times that society should have risen above by now.
I believe that the European countries with the highest standards of living (Switzerland, Sweden) are inherently selfish because they accept lower numbers of poor immigrants from third-world countries.
I believe immigration from countries with high fertility rates to countries with lower fertility rates represents a form of genocide.
I don't believe illegal immigrants are taking away jobs.
I believe that any immigration policy other than open borders is downright immoral.
I believe the downsides of immigration from the third world and modern multiculturalism significantly outweight the positives, and thus Europe should severely limit immigration from Africa and the Middle East. CMV.

It's extreme hyprocisy to be a vegan and have an "on demand" lifestyle-dictated abortion
People shouldn't pierce their babies' ears.
The pro-ife position is incompatible with not punishing women who get abortions
Men should have the right to decide whether or not to support a child financially, if women have the right to abort, in certain situations.
Both State and Federal Governments should have the capability to determine the legality of abortion, and once that capability is determined should rule abortion illegal.
The government should pay for the abortions of fetuses with cognitive disabilities.
Altering DNA, So called "Designer babies", is a steppingstone into the right direction when it comes to human evolution.

The defenses of abortion and slavery are the same thing, and both are wrong.

When artificial wombs are viable, abortion should be outlawed and replaced with moving the fetus to the artificial womb.
Forget about "financial abortion". True post-conception gender equality could be achieved via lottery-based forced adoption of unwanted children.

New York allowing pregnant women at bars to be served alcohol is a perfectly reasonable decision

What Donald Trump said about abortion made perfect logical sense
Donald Trump's recent statement about abortion is really unimportant, and is in fact perfectly rational for a pro-life candidate
