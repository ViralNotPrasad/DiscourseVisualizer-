The debate to allow Syrian refugees into the US is a pointless argument

I believe that the United States should offer a pathway to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants.

I believe immigration from countries with high fertility rates to countries with lower fertility rates represents a form of genocide.
I don't believe illegal immigrants are taking away jobs.
I believe that any immigration policy other than open borders is downright immoral.
I believe the downsides of immigration from the third world and modern multiculturalism significantly outweight the positives, and thus Europe should severely limit immigration from Africa and the Middle East. CMV.

It's extreme hyprocisy to be a vegan and have an "on demand" lifestyle-dictated abortion
People shouldn't pierce their babies' ears.
The pro-ife position is incompatible with not punishing women who get abortions
Men should have the right to decide whether or not to support a child financially, if women have the right to abort, in certain situations.
Both State and Federal Governments should have the capability to determine the legality of abortion, and once that capability is determined should rule abortion illegal.
The government should pay for the abortions of fetuses with cognitive disabilities.

The defenses of abortion and slavery are the same thing, and both are wrong.

What Donald Trump said about abortion made perfect logical sense
Donald Trump's recent statement about abortion is really unimportant, and is in fact perfectly rational for a pro-life candidate
